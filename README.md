# Definitions
* __Subclonal__ "In cancer, subclones are __distinct subpopulations of cells within a tumor__ that have different genetic and/or epigenetic characteristics, originating from a common ancestral cell. These subclones can develop through the accumulation of mutations and other changes as cancer cells evolve and adapt to their environment. Understanding subclones is crucial because they can influence tumor behavior, treatment response, and resistance."

* __Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH)__ "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) happens when a cell called a hematopoietic stem cell, which can develop into different types of blood cells, starts making cells with the same genetic mutation. These blood cells have a different genetic pattern than the rest of your blood cells." [source](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/types/leukemias/risk-factors/clonal-hematopoiesis-ch)

<!-- words that come up that i mostly know to define/look into **soon** like over the weekends?? making a dictionary for myself for the future -->

* Canonical pathway
* Chipseq for validation when RNA-seq doesn‚Äôt give enough information
* Model system in a cell line ‚Äî overexposes the function and mutant and see how it effects the growth
* Immune deconvolution
* Allelic expression ‚Äî what is the other allele doing
* Tumor suppressor
* Gain of function
* LOH
* Truncating mutation
* Frameshift mutations
* Locus
* Functional effect, e.g. mutation does or does not have a functional effect
* MSI
* N-terminal path
* TMB - tumor mutational burden
* Knockout gene
* Wild type allele
* Clonal vs subclonal
* TCGA ‚Äî associate with phenotype, additional cohorts
* Phenotypic difference
* Clinical phenotype
* Survival curve/survival analysis
* Oncogene vs. context dependent tumor suppressor activity
* How to interpret the data: mutually exclusive vs co-occuring patterns
* Validating expression
* Does the gene tolerate loss of function mutation
* Splice mutations/alteration
* Protein stabilization
* Misregulation
* Deleterious
* Gain of function
* Known databases - COMIC and oncoKB
* RNA-seq to see if alteration was expressed, possible to see no expression but still have an effect
* Ubiquinated
* In-frame-deletion
* misannotated mutation
* Exon skipping
* homdels
* Candidate testing
* Recurrent alteration
* For splice site mutations at MSKCC, the p.X_splice format follows this pattern: Format: p.[AminoAcid][Position]_splice

* Isoform e.g. CDKN2Ap14ARF CDKN2Ap16INK4A
* Basic scientist vs. clinician
* Sarcoma
* Colorectal cancer (CRC)
* TP53
* Copy number driven genes
* Genomic alterations
* Missense
* Truncating
* Inframe indel
* Splice
* Amplification
* Rearrangement
* Deep deletion
* MYC
* Primary site
* Fusion
* Oncoprotein
* Driver Alteration
* Tumor microenvironment
* Cellular plasticity
* How does long read sequencing validate fusions
* Canonical marker genes of tumors
* Tumor heterogeneity
* ‚ÄúIt was a clonal event‚Äù
* Resistance to apoptosis
* Oncogenes
* Tumor suppressor genes
* Immune evasion
* Novel (splicing) event
* Cryptic (splicing) event
* Tandem duplication

<!--
# Things I've learned so far
* There's probably no such thing as a "dumb" or "simple" question in cancer, because cancer is so complicated, it turns out the answer is complicated anyway
* Cursing over bad data is completely okay üòÇ
* If IGV is being super slow during screen-sharing on Zoom, turning your camera off makes IGV run fast again

# Remote work hacks
* Literally taking a shower before work or during lunch is the best thing ever ... just makes everything better the whole day
* Nose canceling headphones because someone is always getting their lawn mowed in the morning/afternoon etc. every day
* BenQ ScreenBar Halo is the best table lamp ever
